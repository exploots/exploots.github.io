I spend my days as a penetration tester. With 5+ years of experience working in Cyber Security, my work has spanned major financial and retail companies. My passion remains the same - working collaboratively with companies to help improve the cyber security posture of their applications, products and enterprise environments. 

Currently living in The Netherlands.

A portmanteau formed from the two most impactful stages of a cyber attack / breach:
- **Expl**oitaion
- **Loot**ing (Data exfiltration)
